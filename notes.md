# Git/Github
In the assignment of conflictTest.md, I learned mainly about how git/github works. Here are simple things I learned
To add a completely new respository form github to your computer: git clone <url>
To pull a repository from Github to you local environment, or in other words to open up the file or get it for the first time: git add <filename>
To update edits on the repository from github to the development environment: git pull     --> don't include the file name or anything
Then make whatever changes you want and save (ctr + s)
Then commit the changes/in other words apply the changes and save it: git commit -am "(whatever comments you want explaining what you did)"
The finally push the changes back to github, or in other words save the changes to the cloud of github so that you can access your changes now on github

# Merge
When having merge issues, just when you have the error, change the code from the text editor to where the code matches up or you add a bit of the editing from each github and your development evironment
